<h2>About</h2>

Tactical takedown is a challenging 3D top-down shooter game where the player has to navigate a procedurally generated environment, shooting at enemies, and surviving as long as possible to get the highest score.

<h2>Gameplay Mechanics / Implemented Features:</h2>
Tactical Takedown has a wide range of features and gameplay mechanics as follows:

1. Procedurally generated maps: Every playthrough of the game is a unique experience as the maps are completely procedurally generated. Using various PCG techniques such as the Fisher-Yates Shuffle and flood fill algorithms, the maps are always fool-proof and 100% beatable. The enemies and the player also spawn in random locations every time.
   
2. Game feel: There are camera shakes, sound effects, and background music to really immerse the player in the fast-paced action.

3. UI: A score counter with a streak system, a timer for speedruns, and win & lose screens.

4. Particles and trails: Using the unity particle system, I added bullet trails and enemy death particles.

5. Models and animations: All the models and animations are self made from scratch, including the player, enemies, and guns.
